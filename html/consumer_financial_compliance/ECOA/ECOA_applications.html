  <h1>ECOA Applications</h1>

  <p>Several requirements under ECOA are triggered when a creditor receives an application.</p>

  <p>Under ECOA, an application is an oral or written request for an extension of credit that is made in accordance with procedures used by a creditor for the type of credit requested.</p>

  <p>Under this definition, creditors have latitude to establish their own application processes. Creditors decide the type and amount of information required from credit applicants and how applications must be submitted. For example, a creditor could require that all applications be submitted through an online application portal that collects certain information before an application can be submitted. Alternatively, a creditor could accept applications over the phone.</p>

  <p>For this reason, it is a good idea (though not required under ECOA) for each creditor to establish written application procedures. These procedures should reflect the actual practices the creditor follows for accepting applications. For example, if a creditor’s written procedure says applications must be submitted in writing, but the creditor also accepts applications over the phone, then the creditor’s actual procedures are to accept both oral and written applications. In such cases, ECOA application requirements would apply to applications received by the creditor orally or in writing.</p>

  <p>ECOA distinguishes between inquiries and applications. An inquiry is typically a pre-application event that occurs when a consumer asks a creditor about loan terms. The consumer might express interest in obtaining a loan, ask questions about the process, provide information about themselves, etc. Such inquiries are not applications under ECOA until the consumer submits an application in accordance with the creditor’s procedures.</p>

  <p>However, regardless of whether or not the consumer has submitted an application in accordance with the creditor’s procedures, if the creditor treats the inquiry as an application by making and/or communicating a credit decision, the inquiry is considered an application under ECOA, and all requirements applicable to applications apply. For example, a consumer calls a creditor to inquire about getting a loan and mentions that their credit score is 500. If the creditor tells the consumer that they do not qualify for a loan based on their credit score, the creditor has treated the inquiry as an application under ECOA and must comply with all requirements related to applications (such as adverse action notification requirements). Thus, whether the inquiry becomes an application depends on how the creditor responds to the consumer, not on what the consumer says or asks.</p>

  <p>The following table provides examples of situations in which the creditor’s response to an inquiry determines whether or not an application has been received:</p>

  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <th>Consumer Inquiry</th>
      <th>Remains an Inquiry</th>
      <th>Has Become an Application</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>A consumer calls to ask about loan terms.</td>
      <td>An employee of the creditor explains the creditor's basic loan terms, such as interest rates, loan-to-value ratio, and debt-to-income ratio.</td>
      <td>The loan officer asks the consumer for a ballpark estimate of their yearly income. After receiving the income estimate, the loan officer says that the income is too low to qualify and asks if the consumer has a family member who would be willing to co-sign.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>A consumer calls to ask about interest rates for car loans.</td>
      <td>In order to quote the appropriate rate, the loan officer asks for the make and sales price of the car and the amount of the down payment, then gives the consumer the rate.</td>
      <td>The loan officer asks if the consumer has filed for bankruptcy within the last seven years. The consumer says they filed for bankruptcy two years prior, and the loan officer tells the consumer that they won’t be able to help out with the loan based on the bankruptcy.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>A consumer asks about terms for a loan to purchase a home and tells the loan officer her income and intended down payment.</td>
      <td>The loan officer explains the creditor's loan-to-value ratio policy and other basic lending policies.</td>
      <td>The loan officer informs the consumer that her income is insufficient to qualify for the loan she wants and advises to save up for a larger down payment.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>A consumer calls to ask about terms for a loan to purchase vacant land and states his income and the sales price of the property to be financed, and asks whether he qualifies for a loan.</td>
      <td>An employee of the creditor responds by describing the general lending policies, explaining that he would need to look at all of the consumer's qualifications before making a decision, and offering to send an application form to the consumer.</td>
      <td>An employee of the creditor informs the consumer that they are unlikely to qualify for the loan.</td>
    </tr>

  <p>ECOA distinguishes between prequalification requests and preapproval requests. Prequalification requests are handled in the same way as inquiries (discussed above) under ECOA, but preapproval requests considered under a preapproval program are applications.</p>

  <p>Whether a “prequalification” or “preapproval” request is an application depends on how the creditor handles the request, not the words used to describe the request. Such a request is an application under ECOA if the creditor reviews the request under a preapproval program for which the following is true:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The review is based on a comprehensive analysis of the consumer’s creditworthiness in order to make a credit decision (e.g., approval, denial).</li>
    <li>Upon approval, the institution issues a written commitment valid for a designated period of time to extend a loan up to a specified amount. The written commitment may not be subject to conditions other than:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Conditions that require the identification of adequate collateral,</li>
      <li>Conditions that require no material change in the applicant's financial condition or creditworthiness prior to funding the loan, and</li>
      <li>Limited conditions that are not related to the financial condition or creditworthiness of the applicant that the lender ordinarily attaches to a traditional application (such as certification of a clear termite inspection for a home purchase loan, or a maximum mileage requirement for a used car loan).</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <p>However, if the financial institution does not have such a program, or if the program they have does not meet the conditions described above, requests for preapproval/prequalification are considered “prequalification” requests under ECOA. Just as in the case of inquiries discussed above, whether or not a prequalification request becomes an application under ECOA depends on the creditor’s response. Such requests become applications if the creditor makes and/or communicates a credit decision to the consumer, regardless of whether the request followed the institution’s application procedures.</p>

  <p>For this reason, creditors who consider prequalification or preapproval requests under a process that does not meet the “preapproval program” requirements described above should decide whether they intend to consider such requests as applications under ECOA. For instance, a creditor might have a prequalification program under which a prequalification letter, instead of a written commitment as described above, is provided. Some creditors might consider such requests as applications, while other institutions might require a borrower to have a purchase contract before the prequalification request is considered an application.</p>

  <p>If a creditor wishes to consider such requests as applications, they should be prepared to comply with all applicable requirements triggered by receipt of an application under ECOA. On the other hand, if a creditor does not intend to consider such requests as applications under ECOA, the creditor should implement procedures to ensure that they do not treat such requests as applications. In particular, creditors should be careful not to communicate a denial if they do not wish for the request to be considered an application.</p>

  <p>As a general rule, once a creditor communicates a denial, the creditor has treated the inquiry/prequalification request as an application, and the creditor must comply with all applicable rules, such as providing an adverse action notice. The denial does not have to be explicit. Any communication that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that their application would receive negative consideration is likely to be considered by regulators as a “denial” under ECOA.</p>
